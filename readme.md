# FFXDataParser

## Getting started

1. Get your own legal copy of Final Fantasy X/X-2 Remaster
2. Use **vbfextract** to extract everything from `FFX_Data.vbf`
3. Copy the extracted `ffx_ps2` folder into `src/main/resources/` or put it elsewhere locally (will need to set the `SourcesRootPath` to wherever you put it)
4. Build and run the parser with modes of your choice

## Build & Usage

Building the parser is done by running the following command line in this folder:

`mvn package`

This requires having maven installed on your command line PATH; if you have it installed locally somewhere else, replace the 'mvn' with the complete path to the mvn(.exe) file.

By default, this will create a file inside the `target` folder named `FFXDataParser-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
You can then run the parser with the following command:

`java -jar target/FFXDataParser-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <SourcesRootPath> <ParserMode> [<ModeArgument>] ...`

`SourcesRootPath` must be a path to a folder that contains within it the `ffx_ps2` folder and must end in a `/`. All other paths are relative to this one. If you set it to `.` it will automatically resolve to `src/main/resources/`
