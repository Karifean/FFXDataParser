# FFXDataParser

## Getting started

1. Get your own legal copy of Final Fantasy X/X-2 Remaster
2. Use **vbfextract** to extract everything from `FFX_Data.vbf`
3. Copy the extracted `ffx_ps2` folder into `src/main/resources/` or put it elsewhere locally (will need to set the `SourcesRootPath` to wherever you put it)
4. Build and run the parser with modes of your choice

## Build & Usage

Building the parser is done by running the following command line in this folder:

`mvn package`

This requires having maven installed on your command line PATH; if you have it installed locally somewhere else, replace the 'mvn' with the complete path to the mvn(.exe) file.

By default, this will create a file inside the `target` folder named `FFXDataParser-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
You can then run the parser with the following command:

`java -jar target/FFXDataParser-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <SourcesRootPath> <ParserMode> [<ModeArgument>] ...`

`SourcesRootPath` must be a path to a folder that contains within it the `ffx_ps2` folder and must end in a `/`. All other paths are relative to this one. If you set it to `.` it will automatically resolve to `src/main/resources/`

### Example usages:

`java -jar target/FFXDataParser-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar . GREP Time to go, escargot!`

`java -jar target/FFXDataParser-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar . READ_ALL_ABILITIES`

`java -jar target/FFXDataParser-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar . PARSE_ATEL_FILE ffx_ps2/ffx/master/jppc/event/obj/do/dome0600/dome0600.ebp`

`java -jar target/FFXDataParser-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar . PARSE_MONSTER 105`

## Expected CSV Formats for MAKE_EDITS

The parser mode `MAKE_EDITS` expects .csv files with specific names and formats to be placed inside the resources/edits folder.

The mode also unifies non-string data among affected objects, taking the DEFAULT_LOCALIZATION (normally `us`) as the authoritative copy. For example, if an attack's power is changed in the new_uspc version of it, this will be propagated to all languages.

CSVs are generally expected to have one header line that contains identifiers that assigns certain columns specific roles, and then have 1 line per edit to apply. Columns with no valid identifier in the header line are simply ignored.

The following files can be placed, with the following expected columns (i.e. their header line must consist of the given string):

- `commands.csv` - To make edits to name or description of commands.
  - `id` - Contains command ID written out in hexadecimal, ex. `3037` or `404B` etc.
  - `type` - Must contain either `name` or `description`.
  - `direct copy` - Optionally contains another command ID written out in hexadecimal, in which case it simply clones the string from the given command and does nothing else.
  - `us`/`de`/`fr`/`sp`/`it`/`jp`/`ch`/`kr` - String to insert in the given language.
    - If left empty, no edit is made for that locale.
    - The string must only contain characters valid in the given locale.
    - Newlines must be written as `{\n}`, real newlines are forbidden.
    - Other string commands can also be written using {bracket} notation (you can find the interpreted commands in StringHelper.java functions)
- `autoAbilities.csv` - To make edits to name or description of auto abilities.
  - Exact same columns as commands.csv, IDs are expected to use format `8...`, ex. `800B`
- `keyItems.csv` - To make edits to name or description of key items.
  - Exact same columns as commands.csv, IDs are expected to use format `A...`, ex. `A029`
- `monsterNameSensor.csv` - To make edits to name or sensor texts of monsters.
  - `id` - Contains monster ID written out in decimal, ex. `37` or `251` etc.
  - `type` - Either `name` or `sensor`.
  - `direct copy` - Optionally contains another monster ID written out in decimal, in which case it simply clones the string from the given monster and does nothing else.
  - `us`/`de`/`fr`/`sp`/`it`/`jp`/`ch`/`kr` - String to insert in the given language, usual rules apply.
- `monsterScan.csv` - To make edits to scan texts of monsters.
  - Contains the same columns as monsterNameSensor.csv except no type column.
- `events.csv` - To make edits to event/field script file texts.
  - `id` - Contains event ID written out as a string, ex. `bika0000` or `mtgz0700` etc.
  - `string index` - Numeric ID of the given string in decimal
  - `us`/`de`/`fr`/`sp`/`it`/`jp`/`ch`/`kr` - String to insert in the given language, usual rules apply.
- `encounter.csv` - To make edits to encounter/battle script file texts.
  - `id` - Contains encounter ID written out as a string, ex. `cdsp07_00` or `stbv01_10` etc.
  - `string index` - Numeric ID of the given string in decimal
  - `us`/`de`/`fr`/`sp`/`it`/`jp`/`ch`/`kr` - String to insert in the given language, usual rules apply.
